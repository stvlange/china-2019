And so it begins. On Friday July 14th we headed to O'Hare airport to head back to China for a Heritage tour and a return visit to our daughter's orphanage. This is something that we had been planning and saving up for to do for more than five years. 

When we originally travelled to China to adopt our daughter we went solo, which looking back on it now was honestly pretty ambitious of us. This time around we opted to use a tour company called [Lotus Travel](http://www.lotustours.net/). The owner, Mr. Louie who lives in Seattle was extremely helpful answering questions and customizing the tour for our specific needs and as it turns out, accompanied the three tour groups that were part of this trip.

Another change from the first time around is that I am writing these memories down after getting back home. Why? Well to be honest we were all exhausted every single day after finishing up the daily tour activities. Between the heat, the sightseeing and the travel between cities there wasn't a lot of time left to journal so these thoughts are coming to you from back in the US.
